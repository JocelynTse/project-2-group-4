# PROJECT PROPOSAL : Central Hub for Sporting Associations
### Introduction
UT Coding Bootcamp – Project team #4 was forged in the  to complete project #2 requirements
The team will execute a web development initiative to improve work processes and user experience surrounding sports registration.
The intended software will provide a central hub for sporting associations management to move away from a manual paper or Microsoft Excel-based work processes, as well provide an enhanced user experience to its participating members (up to 2000 unique members).
The intended development effort is to be undertaken using an Agile framework based on a most viable product definition. Sprint plans will be laid out as part of Phase 1 kick off activities.
 
### Needs/Problems

* Creation of "Excel hell" – an inability to easily store, access, update membership information among association team members
* Inability to quickly share information and updates with members
* Inability for members to quickly search for and get involved in sporting opportunities
* Inability to audit outstanding membership dues

### Goals/Objectives
Creating a central sporting registration hub that scales easily to demand is the proposed solution. The registration hub will:
* Be easy to use and branded per sporting association requirements
* Scale to membership growth (up to 2000 members)
* Provide members with quick view of current and upcoming sporting opportunities
* Provide members with an interface to search and find nearest sporting venues
* Provide members with an intuitive search interface to find sporting apparel and equipment
* Provide intuitive administrative features that allow management to  update key areas of site
* Other nice to have features are: (Stretch Goals)
   * Chat Bot that answers membership Frequently Asked Questions
   * A 3D interactive sporting model on landing page
